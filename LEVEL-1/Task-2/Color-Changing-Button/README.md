# LEVEL-1  --> TASK-2(a)

## TASK DESCRIPTION :-

Develop a basic button that changes its color when clicked using JavaScript.

## THE SOLUTION :-

- Build a basic HTML structure with a simple button.
- Add the styling to the page.

To add the functionality(Change color when clicked), I have used Javascript.

- Access the button element using Javascript DOM selectors.
- Declare a variable and assign '0123456789ABCDEF' to it. As we can see '0123456789ABCDEF' contains all the numbers (0 to 9) and characters (A to F). The HEX-CODE of a color always contains 6 of these '0123456789ABCDEF'.
- Add an "click" EventListener to the button element and whenever the button will be clicked a function'```generateRandomColor()```' will be called.

The whole javascript code contains 2 number of functions. Let's know what the functions are doing actually.

> 1. ``generateRandomColor()`` --->

- This functon is made for ganarating Random colors for the button.
- In the for loop it is generating random number for every iteration and adding the element (having the index number equal to the random number) to the color variable. After completing all the iterations now the color variable have a valid HEX-CODE.
- Call the ``changeBtnColor(randomColor)`` function.

> 2. ``changeBtnColor(randomColor)`` --->
- It simply replace the background color of the button element to the random color (Generated by the ``generateRandomColor()``).
